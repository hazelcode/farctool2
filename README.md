# About
### What is farctool2?
farctool2 is a program I wrote for two reasons:
1. To learn how Java can read and manipulate data streams, and
2. Because I already knew the structures of the file formats this game used.

### Disclaimer
This program frankly isn't very good. It's messy and everything is disgustingly written. It was my first full-fledged Java application and that's very visible in how poor the code is and how much I stole. I've moved development over to OpenCWLib, which you can eventually use to create your own farctool3 -> https://github.com/philosophofee/OpenCWLib

### Why farctool "2"?
farctool2 is the sequel to the original farctool, which was written in Game Maker 8.0.

# Features
 - Supports loading of .farc and .map files from every LBP game.
 - Supports texture viewing from every LBP game except LBP Vita. (Planned - for now use this: http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=139837&sid=f273e4c12cf5ce94f7f147626b117bd3#p139837)
 - Supports extraction of any compressed data file from LBP game.
 - Hex viewer (ft. Sporst)
 - Plaintext viewer for text-based files.
 - Supports dumping dependency list of LBP assets with reverse-lookup on GUIDs to filenames.

# Planned
 - LBP Vita GXT texture viewing. 
 - Decompression and recompression of any file in the game.
 - Farc building.
 - Level editor.
 - Model viewer and exporter.
 - General Material (GMAT) viewer.
 - .plan generator (LBP1 ONLY) for music and costume pieces.
 - Model importer.
 
# Disclaimer
I did not create any of the games in question nor am I affiliated with any of the developers of these video games.
All researched data was acquired via means of downloading game package files through a public database of direct-to-PSN URLs with no protection.
Nothing malicious is intended. This program was written as a labor of love for the franchise and as a budding programmer's first major project.
